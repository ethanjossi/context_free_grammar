The purpose of this code is to create a "Context Free Grammar" generator.
The idea behind context free grammar is to create a set of rules for generating sentences.
These sentences are very basic in principle, given a basic set of rules the following strings could be generated, for example:

the cat bit the dog.
the girl chased the boy.
the cat chased the boy and the boy kissed the cat.
the cat bit the dog and the dog kissed the girl and the dog chased the girl. 

These sentences were generated from a few basic words (Dog, boy, cat, girl) as well as an idea of verbs vs. nouns.

These two code files aim to provide the tools necessary to achieve context free grammar. my_rng provides random number generation and functions.
cfg provides functions to generate context free grammar. cfg also has a main() to showcase and example of how it works.
